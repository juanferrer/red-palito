# Red Palito
It is mainly an experiment to try a WebGL based framework. I'm using [Three.js r100](https://threejs.org/)
([Repo](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/)).

It's a classic survival, so the objetive of the game is to stay alive as long as possible while killing
as many enemies as possible. The main inspiration for the logic of the game
is [BoxHead](http://www.boxheadgame.com/).

> You can't win. You can only eventually loose.

Stuff will be added and may end up being something fun.
